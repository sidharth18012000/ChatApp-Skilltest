This is a frontend implementation of a chat application built using React, where users can engage in conversations with their contacts. The application allows users to search for conversations by contact name, view and send messages, and manage conversations.

# Features :- Search Conversations: Users can search for conversations based on contact names.

Left Sidebar :- Displays a list of all conversations with contact names and snippets of the last messages. "Create Conversation" button opens a pop-up displaying contacts from the provided dummy data. Clicking on a contact initiates a new conversation or opens an existing one.

Right Side View :- Shows the messages of the currently selected conversation. Users can send messages within the conversation. Error and Success Alerts: The application handles errors and displays appropriate alerts or notifications.

React Router: The application uses react-router for routing between different views.

React Hooks: React hooks are exclusively used to manage component state and lifecycle.

Bonus Feature (Optional):Redux is used to store chat messages and conversations, ensuring persistence after a refresh.
